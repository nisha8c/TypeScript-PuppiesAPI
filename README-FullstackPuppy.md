# Salt React Fullstack - TypeScript Addon

## Task
Your task is to create a frontend to the API that you created the other day, aka `puppiesAPI`.
This is a good app to put in your portfolio, so even though it does not have any design requirements, make it look nice. The application should be built with React and TypeScript

Requirements for the UI:
- It should display the initial puppies that exist in the DB on first load.
- It should have the possibility to add a new puppy.
- It should have the possibility to update an existing puppy.
- It should display details when clicking on a selected puppy.
- It should be able to delete a puppy from the DB.

### Extra challenge
Fetch an image from Unsplash API (or similar) and aggregate the data in your own API to include the image with the rest of the puppy information.
